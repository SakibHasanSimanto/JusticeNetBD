(8) If after the conclusion of evidence, it appears that the investigating officer, either personally or under the direction of a superior officer, deliberately shielded a person from prosecution by failing to collect or consider material evidence or by treating that person as a witness rather than an accused, or by failing to examine any important witness, the tribunal may mark such act or negligence as incompetence or misconduct and direct the controlling authority to take appropriate legal action against the officer concerned.

If the accused fails to appear within the stipulated time, the tribunal may proceed with the trial in their absence. However, if the accused appears before the tribunal or is brought before it, or is released on bail and subsequently absconds, the above provision shall not apply, and the tribunal may complete the trial in the accused’s absence only after recording reasons for doing so.

(2) The magistrate so requested shall record the statement at the scene or any other appropriate place, and the recorded statement shall be sent directly by the investigating officer or person to the tribunal along with the investigation report for submission. (3) If during the trial of an accused in the tribunal it is found that the testimony of the person who gave the recorded statement under subsection (2) is necessary but that person has died, is unable to testify, cannot be located, or bringing them to the tribunal would cause undue delay, expense, or hardship, the tribunal may accept the recorded statement as evidence in the case; provided, however, that the tribunal shall not convict the accused solely based on such recorded statement.

**Section 23** of the Women and Children Repression Prevention Act, 2000 states that if any government-appointed doctor, chemical examiner, assistant chemical examiner, blood examiner, handwriting expert, fingerprint expert, or firearms expert conducts any examination or analysis related to an offense under this Act and submits a report during the investigation or proceedings, but later dies, becomes unable to testify, cannot be found, or if summoning them to the tribunal would cause undue delay, expense, or hardship not justified by the circumstances, then the tribunal may accept their signed examination report as evidence during the trial. However, the tribunal cannot convict the accused solely based on this report.

Section 24 of the Women and Children Repression Prevention Act, 2000 states that (1) for the purpose of summoning witnesses or executing warrants in trials under this Act, the summons or warrant must be sent to the officer-in-charge of the police station where the witness’s last known residence is located, and it is the responsibility of that officer to ensure the witness’s attendance before the tribunal. (2) Despite subsection (1), a copy of the summons must also be sent by registered post with acknowledgment receipt to the concerned witness and to the district police superintendent or, as applicable, the police commissioner. (3) If a police officer deliberately neglects to execute any summons or warrant under this section, the tribunal may classify such negligence as incompetence and direct the controlling authority of the officer to take disciplinary action. (4) Upon request by any person or at its own discretion, the tribunal may, subject to relevant laws, record the testimony of any remote witness through information technology means, and for this purpose, the government and other authorities shall provide the tribunal with the necessary technological equipment.**Section 24Ka** of the Women and Children Repression Prevention Act, 2000 states that in cases where the victim of an offense is incapable of giving consent or dissent regarding a particular act, the tribunal may, based on other evidence, presume that the victim did not consent to that act.

**Section 25** of the Women and Children Repression Prevention Act, 2000 provides that (1) unless otherwise specified in this Act, the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure shall apply to the filing of complaints, investigation, trial, and disposal of offenses under this Act.

Section 31 of the Women and Children Repression Prevention Act, 2000 states that during the investigation or trial of any offense under this Act, if the tribunal or, as the case may be, the magistrate considers it necessary to keep any woman, child, or their related person in protective custody or to ensure the overall protection of their life and property, then in accordance with the provisions of the Children Act, 2013 (Act No. 24 of 2013), the tribunal or magistrate may order to place the said woman or child outside prison in the custody of government authorities at a place designated by the government for this purpose, or in the custody of any other suitable person or organization deemed appropriate by the tribunal or magistrate, or take any other suitable measures.

Under the Women and Children Repression Prevention Act, 2000, Section 31 states that during the investigation or trial of any offense under this Act, if the tribunal or magistrate considers it necessary to keep any woman, child, or their related person in protective custody or to ensure the overall protection of their life and property, then in accordance with the Children Act, 2013 (Act No. 24 of 2013), the tribunal or magistrate may order that the woman or child be placed outside prison in the custody of government authorities at a government-designated place or in the custody of any other suitable person or organization deemed appropriate by the tribunal or magistrate, or take any other suitable measures for their protection.

The attending doctor at such a hospital is required to complete the medical examination promptly and, within seventy-two hours of completion, provide a free medical certificate to the victim or their family and the investigating officer, while also informing the local police station of the offense. If the medical examination is not completed within a reasonable time, after reviewing an explanatory report, the controlling authority, medical order-issuing authority, magistrate, tribunal, or other relevant authority may determine that the responsible doctor’s negligence or misconduct caused the delay; such incompetence and misconduct shall be recorded in the doctor's confidential annual report, appropriate disciplinary action shall be taken according to service rules, and the tribunal may order the appointing or relevant authority to take measures against the doctor for dereliction of duty.

Under the Women and Children Repression Prevention Act, 2000, Section 32K states that besides the medical examination under Section 32, the investigating officer may, considering the case and its circumstances, order DNA testing of the accused and the victim of an offense under this Act in accordance with the DNA Act, 2014 (Act No. 10 of 2014) and its rules, regardless of whether the person consents or not; however, such DNA testing requires prior approval from the tribunal or the competent magistrate. If the investigating officer does not conduct the DNA test with such approval, they must state the reason, accuracy, and approval details in their investigation report. Furthermore, in cases related to rape offenses under this Act, when DNA samples are sent to a DNA laboratory, the test must be conducted on a priority basis, and the results should be delivered to the investigating officer or, as applicable, to the tribunal or competent magistrate within the shortest possible time.

Under the Women and Children Repression Prevention Act, 2000, Section 32Kh empowers the tribunal or, as applicable, the magistrate to issue necessary orders and take measures to provide security or protection to the complainant, victim, or any witness in an ongoing investigation or trial, either upon their application or on its own accord. Additionally, the tribunal may order the provision of reasonable compensation for travel and time expenses to witnesses attending cases filed under this Act, and for this purpose, the government shall allocate separate funds to support each tribunal accordingly.

Under the Women and Children Repression Prevention Act, 2000, Section 33 grants the government the authority to formulate rules by issuing notifications in the official government gazette to fulfill the objectives of this Act.

Under the Women and Children Repression Prevention Act, 2000, Section 34 states that the Women and Children Repression (Special Provisions) Act, 1995 (Act No. 18 of 1995), hereinafter referred to as the repealed Act, is hereby repealed. However, any pending cases under the repealed Act before the relevant tribunals, as well as appeals against orders, judgments, or sentences given in such cases, shall be conducted and disposed of as if the repealed Act had not been repealed. Additionally, any reports, complaints, charge sheets filed, or investigations ongoing under the repealed Act shall be deemed to be cases pending in the courts mentioned in the preceding subsection. The special courts formed under the repealed Act for women and children repression shall be considered tribunals under this Act and shall dispose of the aforementioned cases in accordance with the provisions of this Act.

Under the Women and Children Repression Prevention Act, 2000, Section 35 provides special provisions regarding the offence described in Clause (g) of Section 11. Notwithstanding anything contained in the Act, from the date of enforcement of the Women and Children Repression Prevention (Amendment) Ordinance, 2025, the offence under Section 11(g) shall be triable and cognizable by a First Class Magistrate. However, any pending cases filed under Section 11(g) before the Women and Children Repression Prevention Tribunal prior to the enforcement of the 2025 Ordinance shall not be transferred to the Magistrate Court, and all such pending cases filed, investigated, or appealed before the enforcement of the Ordinance shall be conducted and disposed of as though the Ordinance was never enforced. Furthermore, the offence described in Section 11(g) shall be considered cognizable, non-compoundable, and non-bailable, and for all procedural matters including complaint filing, investigation, trial, appeal, and disposal, the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Evidence Act, 1872 shall apply instead of the special provisions of this Act. However, if the offence under Section 11(g) is intricately linked with an offence triable by the Tribunal such that justice requires both to be tried together, then the offence under Section 11(g) may also be tried in the Tribunal along with the other offence under this Act.

According to the Dowry Prohibition Act 2018 section 1, the term "party" refers to the groom or bride involved in the marriage, or their parents, or in their absence, a lawful guardian, or any other person directly related to the marriage on either side. The term "dowry" means any money, goods, or property given or agreed to be given, directly or indirectly, by one party to the other as a condition for marriage, before or during the marriage, or to continue the marital relationship. However, this does not include dower (mahr) under Muslim personal law (Shariah) or gifts given at the time of marriage by relatives, friends, or well-wishers to either party.

According to Section 3 of the Dowry Prohibition Act 2018, if either party to a marriage directly or indirectly demands any dowry from the other party, it is considered a punishable offense under this law. The offender may face imprisonment for up to 5 years but not less than 1 year, or a fine up to 50,000 taka, or both imprisonment and fine. According to Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act 2018, if any party to a marriage gives or receives dowry, assists in giving or receiving dowry, or makes an agreement to give or receive dowry, such actions are offenses under this law. The person involved may be punished with imprisonment for up to 5 years but not less than 1 year, or a fine up to 50,000 taka, or both imprisonment and fine. According to Section 5 of the Dowry Prohibition Act 2018, any agreement related to giving or receiving dowry shall be considered null and void for the purposes of enforcing this law.

Even if the court orders possession of the whole or part of the shared residence in favor of the aggrieved person, such order will not affect the respondent’s ownership rights or interests in that residence. If the court has reasonable grounds to believe that it is necessary to temporarily evict the respondent from the shared residence to ensure the safety of the aggrieved person, it may order such eviction. However, this order will not apply if safe shelter or alternative accommodation can be provided for the aggrieved person or if the court is satisfied that the eviction order is no longer necessary.
The court may impose any other conditions or directions it considers appropriate to protect the safety of the aggrieved person, their children, or other family members. The court may require the respondent to execute a bond with or without surety, promising not to commit any acts of domestic violence in the future. When issuing any order under this section, the court may also direct the officer-in-charge of the relevant police station to take necessary measures in writing to ensure the safety of the aggrieved person and their children.

The court must dispose of this compensation application within six months of receiving it. While deciding the application, the court will give both parties the opportunity to be heard and may order the respondent to pay financial compensation to the aggrieved person as it deems appropriate, subject to the provisions of sub-section (4). Before deciding, the court may assign a person or institution to assess the actual extent of damage. The court will consider factors such as the nature and extent of physical and mental harm to the aggrieved person, medical expenses, short- and long-term effects of the harm, impact on current and future earnings, the amount and value of movable or immovable property that was transferred, handed over, destroyed, or damaged, and reasonable expenses already incurred due to domestic violence by the aggrieved person or someone on their behalf.
The court may also order the respondent to pay sufficient and reasonable maintenance money for the livelihood of the aggrieved person and their children, allowing them to maintain their accustomed standard of living. This maintenance can be ordered as a lump sum or monthly payment. A copy of the compensation order must be sent to the concerned parties and the police officer-in-charge of the jurisdiction where the respondent usually resides or stays. If the respondent is employed by any government, semi-government, autonomous, or private organization, a copy of the order must also be sent to their employer.
